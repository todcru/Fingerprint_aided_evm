# Fingerprint_aided_evm
The EVM is based on the fingerprint and facial recognition has been researched the longest period and shows the most promising future in real world application. Because of their uniqueness and consistency over time, fingerprint and facial recognition have been used for identification over time by using this feature voting system can be made more secured. EVM is faster, efficient, reliable and error free, also easy to operate which reduces the chances of errors. Decisions are shown in few seconds just by pressing a result button after the evoting has been conducted.
 
INTRODUCTION
 
Voting is the process of electorate to decide or express an opinion. In olden days, voting machines were used by the administrative authorities to reduce the risk of errors or manipulations also to control the administrative costs of elections. In this project advanced machine of balloting is determined based totally on digital voting tool the brand new function of this device is biometric protection in an effort be accomplished to found out by the fingerprints of the voters. The particular identity of the each and every person will be there fingerprints which is one of the cheapest way of popularity the fingerprint reputation might be the exceptional for builders to use this biometric the authorities also taken vital steps the government also provided Aadhaar card to become person specific identity. In this project we increase on a digital vote casting method to remove fraudulent practices all through public elections related to double person identification checks facial recongnization and finger print based totally completely identification techniques facial reputation is finished through feature extraction based definitely machine learning set of rules at the same time as finger print based identification.


HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

1. Raspberry pi
2. Power Supply unit
3. Arduino UNO
4. LCD(Liquid-Crystal Displays)
5. Finger print reader
6. Pi camera
7. Push Button Switches (Keys)

RESULT

The main aim of this system to meet the fair, reliable and transparent election kit which will reduce the rate of fraudulence and help to provide a fair, easy and fast election voting system. India is the country with more than 130 crore population. Due to the lack of knowledge of voting of uneducated people and due to the laziness of the educated people, India is still a developing country. To make our country strong we need 100%voting and to choose the best leader. This is done easily by smart voting system, the main things related to smart voting is voter’s Aadhar card details and fingerprint, face recongnization authentication. Extra security has been brought in comparison to traditional electronic vote casting device by means of adding fingerprint, face recongnization feature so that there can’t be any kind of dishonest. By using of this system the country wide vote casting system might be quicker. The identity control which was done manually is eliminated due to use of the smart card with authentication each is more secure and makes this systemfaster. In this project most important benefit is that because fingerprints of all have various and subsequently this system completely reduces the chance of invalid votes.

Facial recognition technology is not a new phenomenon; the first experimentations with the technology can be seen from the 1960s. The technique astern the software is more analytical, automatic which is depended on the clone whereas the initial image required a higher level of mortal input hence they prevailed as a semi-automated. Every individual has number of differentiable vestiage which make a special facial feature. Each individual elector face has relatively almost 80 nodal points few among these are systematic by facial recognition technology considering some features such as
The shape of the cheekbones
Distance between the eyes
Depth of the eye sockets
Width of the nose
The length of the jaw line.
There is four-level technique the biometric structure function.

Seizure-The real or the observable pattern is secured by the scheme amid enrolment process.

Exadication– Individual statistics from the sample and the impression arrangement is set up based on captured data.

Comparison – The impression prevailed later is correlated along with a identical pattern.

Matching - The scheme thus determines that the visage exact from the current pattern is identical or different. When the elector stands in front of the camera, the system will make the face print of that person and it will verify with the data in the database. If match not found, he may need to go for another attempt. This scheme generally takes the verdict within the less period of time.

FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION:
As maximum fingerprint recognition scanner are primarily based on very comparable hardware standards, additional components and software also can play a major component special manufactures use unique algorithms to discover key fingerprint traits, which could adjust in velocity and accuracy typically those algorithms look for where in a ridge splits and line case collectively those are different exclusive features are known as minutiae if a scanned fingerprint matches several of these trivia then it is going to be considered as in shape comparing minutiae reduces quantity processing electricity required to discover the fingerprint and allows to avoid fakes if scanned fingerprint smudged and permits the finger placed off center.
